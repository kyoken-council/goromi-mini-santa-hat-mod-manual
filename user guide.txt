These files are basic game files not packaged into
a mod format, and are thus NOT SRMM compatible.
Sorry. I tried. SRMM just wasn't cooperating.
For manual Yakuza 0/Kiwami modelswapping only.

Before starting, it's recommended to back up the
original files you're swapping over so as to avoid 
having to reinstall the game to get them back. Although
steam's "verify integrity of game files" feature can 
usually do this for you, sometimes it just doesn't.

HOW TO USE
To swap these models over Goromi's default models,
simply unpack the zip folders (they're only
zipped to keep them organised), then copy and paste
c_am_majima_caba into kiwami's auth folder, and
c_cm_majima_caba into kiwami's adv folder, and let
your computer replace the original folders with the
new ones. (This is why it's ideal to back them up
first)

To swap them over any other Majima model, just copy
and paste the CONTENTS of either folder (not the folder
itself) into any y0 or k1 Majima model within the same
type of folder (only swap c_AM_majima_caba's contents 
into auth models, only swap c_CM_majima_caba's 
contents into adv models. You can swap them into models 
with different prefixes, though, like swapping 
c_am_majima_caba's contents into c_at_majima.)

Once you know how to do this, you can copy and paste
ANY model onto any other model of the same character,
not just these ones! So you could play through the entirety
of Yakuza 0 as Everyone's Idol Goro and karaoke Kiryu
if you so pleased.

Have fun!
